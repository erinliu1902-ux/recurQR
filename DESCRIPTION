Description: Implements the two-step estimation procedure proposed in
    Liu, Umpierrez, and Peng (2025) for modeling recurrent episode lengths
    via quantile regression while addressing dependent truncation, dependent
    censoring, and informative cluster size.
    The method uses a first-stage quantile regression on within-subject
    differences to estimate time-dependent covariate effects, and a second-stage
    weighted quantile regression to estimate time-independent covariate effects.
